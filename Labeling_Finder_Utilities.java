/*
	this function is the primary permutation generator. this is where we have to "prune" off the labeling list to only use the first number_to_use numbers. This is a formality since the number of edges on a graph is what we're trying to make a rainbow, while the number of vertexes may be far fewer than the number of edges

	Since it's gotten rather lengthy, here's the argument list and why they're there:
		previous_valud_permutation
			This is a List<Integer> and represents the last valid permutation that was tried. This is needed to make sure that we aren't creating duplicate labelings.
		current_workingList
			This is also a List<Integer> and represents the permutation that we're currently building. We recursively build this, so it is passed from iteration to iteration.
		array_to_permute
			This is a int[] and represents the input array that we are choosing permutations from. This isn't destructively touched through the iterations, because we use current_working_list as a destructable version of this array.
		used_indexes
			This is a boolean[] and represents the indexes of array_to_permute that have been used. This is neccesary so we can keep track of which indexes have been used so we don't label multiple vertexes with the same value. This is necessary because we aren't destructively altering array_to_permute.
		number_to_use
			This is a int and represents the number of vertexes on the graph (aside from the one that we're fixing)
		input_edge_relation
			This is a Edge_Relation and represents the graph we are labeling. This is neccesary since we'll be creating the graph within this funciton. We initially were just creating the list of permutations, but since that'd take too much RAM for the larger graphs (more than 10 vertexes) to be feasible.
		input_modulo
			This is the modulo that we are working under when creating the graph. This is neccesary for the same reason that the input_edge_relation is needed.
		input_fixed_labeling
			This is a int and represents a labeling that is assigned to vertex with name 0 on the graph. This is needed because we want to multithread the process, and this is how we will be determining different threads.
		loop_counter
			This is a Big_Integer_Counter and represents the number of iterations we have tested a graph. This isn't neccesary for proper operation, but for diagnostic reasons we include it.
		output_path
			This is a String and represents where the output will be pushed. This is neccesary because the parralellized nature of this will mean that the command prompt window may be updated out of order, leading to confusion of the user.
		input_thread
			this is the thread that will be executing the iteration of this method. This is neccesary because system.exit() stops all of the currently running threads.
